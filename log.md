# 100 Days Of Code - The Log

## The Why

The past couple of years, I've been maintaining an open-source passion project, [Legesher](https://github.com/legesher). üí° This translator for code has challenged me not only as a software developer to learn new technologies, but as a developer of people to encourage and support the community that surrounds the project. üåç

In September of 2020, my husband and I welcomed are precious daughter, [Forbearance](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFBHSpOFmbT/), into this world. Life with a newborn has been similar to when I first started programming in college - overwhelming amounts of new information, lots of trial and error, and too many days without showering üò¨. It's easy for growth to go unnoticed, for I look at pictures of my daughter from the day before and sometimes they seems ages apart.

My hopes for the next 100 days are to release the first version of Legesher and spur others on to learn and develop the tools needed for their next step. Enjoy this mommy and me version of #100DaysOfCode.

### Day 1: November 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
