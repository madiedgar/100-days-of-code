# 100 Days Of Code - The Log

## The Why

The past couple of years, I've been maintaining an open-source passion project, [Legesher](https://github.com/legesher). üí° This translator for code has challenged me not only as a software developer to learn new technologies, but as a developer of people to encourage and support the community that surrounds the project. üåç

In September of 2020, my husband and I welcomed are precious daughter, [Forbearance](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFBHSpOFmbT/), into this world. Life with a newborn has been similar to when I first started programming in college - overwhelming amounts of new information, lots of trial and error, and too many days without showering üò¨. It's easy for growth to go unnoticed, for I look at pictures of my daughter from the day before and sometimes they seems ages apart.

My hopes for the next 100 days are to release the first version of Legesher and spur others on to learn and develop the tools needed for their next step. Enjoy this mommy and me version of #100DaysOfCode.

### Day 1: November 11, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: One of the things I'm learning for Legesher is API development so that the translations can be available throughout the project. I started the [API's and Microservices Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) curriculum to improve upon the API's development. The focus of today was managing packages with NPM.

**Special Shoutout** to [@apharrison964](https://github.com/apharrison964) for starting this with me. üéâ you're the best.

### Day 2: November 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've continued the [API's and Microservices Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) curriculum from FreeCodeCamp to improve upon the API's development. Today's focus was on refreshing myself with routing by building a basic node and express application on repl.it.

### Day 3: November 13, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Again, I've continued the [API's and Microservices Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) curriculum from FreeCodeCamp to improve upon the API's development. Today's focus was on database management with mongodb and mongoose. I haven't messed with Mongodb since in college, so it's been a while

### Day 6: November 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed all of the lessons in [API's and Microservices Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) curriculum from FreeCodeCamp. Today I played around with the mongodb and mongoose module more to better understand them.

### Day 8: November 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Though I‚Äôm trying to spend most of these days coding, product management and code reviews are skills that I‚Äôd like to build upon. üîç

Today, I reviewed several PR‚Äôs for Legesher‚Äôs `Legesher-translation` repository. üíª

### Day 9: November 19, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Began the process of syncing the recent changes of the `tree-sitter-python` repo with Legesher‚Äôs `tree-sitter-legesher-python` repository to see what changes overlap.

Thanks to an amazing contributor, an issue is created with latest changes from the original repo for me to review.

### Day 10: November 20, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Was not expecting to spend so much time reconfiguring the command line after the Mac OS Big Sur update. Ended up having to reinstall Command Line Tools in order to make progress on anything.

### Day 11: November 21, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Continued the sync for Tree-Sitter-Legesher-Python with Tree-Sitter's `tree-sitter-python` repository. This takes account a lot of testing and precision to make sure the changes made in the original repository actually apply for Legesher's repository.

### Day 12: November 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the sync for Tree-Sitter-Legesher-Python with Tree-Sitter's `tree-sitter-python` repository. New tests were added to the CI, so had to execute an elaborate regex to restructure the data for the known_failures.txt file.

### Day 14: November 24, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Began and completed the sync of changes from Atom's `language-python` repository for the Atom editor on `language-legesher-python`. Upgraded the `tree-sitter-legesher-python` version for the repository as well, so both are the most up to date.
