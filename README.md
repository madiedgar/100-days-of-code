# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

This is based off of [Kallaway's #100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) and more information can be found [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/). You can follow my progress on this [repository's log](log.md) and on my social media ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/withmadico) & [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/withmadico/)). But these things are always easier with friends - so join me (and dm me so we can encourage one another on the journey and I'll add your start date on my log)!
